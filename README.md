If you have two different mods that have the same recipe using the same materials, then you got a conflict, and you would have no way to get access to all the items by the intended means.

This mod allows multiple recipes sharing the same crafting layout to be crafted, the player being able to choose using either a cycle button, or a new key binding.

How many recipes are conflicting is also displayed.

See generated configuration file: recipehandler.cfg for options.

 
This mod makes the best efforts to support other crafting tables, using an automated detection system, but gives no guarantee that behavior will match desired outcome.


###Mod installation procedure:
* Install [Forge](http://files.minecraftforge.net/)
* Download the mod and put it in your mods folder (or mods/'mc version' starting from 1.6.2)
